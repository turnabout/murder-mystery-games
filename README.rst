~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
https://store.steampowered.com/app/377670/Gsenjou_no_Maou__The_Devil_on_GString/

Don't know much about it but it seems highly regarded. From a review: 

"That little synopsis doesn't even scratch the surface of the story as the plot
twists and turns in ways that will have you dizzy before long. Kidnap, murder,
betrayal, deceit, revenge - there are very few atrocities not touched upon, and
the writers bring it all to life with fast-paced action, vivid imagery, and
lively banter between the characters."

Really good MM games I've played (favorites)
--------------------------------------------
Raging Loop

Visual novel where you play a "real" game of Werewolf in a secluded village.

Your Turn to Die (incomplete, last chapter not out yet)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
https://vgperson.com/games/yourturntodie.htm

Free game. 11 people are trapped together in a facility and have to go through a
"death game" to survive. Will probably make you cry.

Umineko 
~~~~~~~
https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/

Long visual novel (almost 1 million total word count). Intricate murder mystery
mostly happening on a family-owned secluded island. Has a lot of layers to it.
It's a journey. Will make you cry.

Others (not murder mystery but...)
----------------------------------
Fatal Twelve
~~~~~~~~~~~~
https://store.steampowered.com/app/620210/Fatal_Twelve/

I think it's not exactly mystery but seems interesting. A girl dies in an
explosion, but is brought back to life, as well as 11 other dead people. They
have to eliminate each other so the last one standing will truly have their
death revoked. It seems a bit more like a thriller, but interesting.
